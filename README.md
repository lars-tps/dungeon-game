# This is a simple dungeon game made using python 3.

# Currently, this script is capable of:
- Generating a list of coordinates (as tuples) based on user input of height and width
- Displaying the map grid
- Randomly selects 3 coordinates from the list of generated coordinates to be assigned to player, monster, door
- Takes user input to move 'player' around

# Plans for more features:
- Making the monster move instead of remaining static
- Display approximate location of monster, or display player distance to monster
